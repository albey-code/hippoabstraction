Then, specify a run regressor in the GLM, so that it knows which run is which as a constant of 1s for a certain run and 0s for the other two. But! this means that I will need to re-run the GLM with aforementioned run regressor. In the end, I would get a concatenated version of the betas (instead of a mean beta for each object and each voxel)."
